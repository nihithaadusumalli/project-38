Infinite Runner game... 

## INSTRUCTIONS:
____________________________________________________________________________________
## Goal of the Project:
In Class 38 you learnt how to play around with the camera and set the size of the canvas to
the height and width of the device.
In this project, you will have to take one of your games (Trex, Monkey Go Happy) and
recreate it using the camera moving in the X-direction.
Story:
This is a story in your life. The next few hours of creating a game in this project is the story
you are creating. Make it a memorable one.
This is a challenging endeavor and I am sure you will make a great game. Letâ€™s go!

## Getting Started:
1. Make a copy of one of your existing games to start this project.
2. Rename the folder as Project 38.
3. Import this folder into VS Code.
4. Start editing your code in sketch.js.
Specific Tasks to complete the Project:
Until now we have used the X and Y positions or framecount to determine if the
background should change or new obstacles should be put in the path of the playing
character.
The other way to achieve this whole concept is to move the camera in the X direction,
towards the left or right and achieve the movement.
1. Use the position of the camera to randomly create obstacles or food or coins as your
game requires.
2. Relook at either the Trex Game or Monkey Go Happy Game and redesign it with the
camera moving and all characters in the game staying still.
3. Make sure the project works before you submit it.
